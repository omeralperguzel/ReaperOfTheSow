This project is made for Greeny Game Jam 2022 with the team less people than I anticipated. For now this game has 1 level, cutscene system and the main menu system. But the reason we put it here is not just adding this project to the Github but develop it even further.

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. Most of the major changes normally won't be allowed since it is intended to showing the result of our game jam project. But improvements of it could be done in another branch someday.
